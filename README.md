# Exlings

Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing elixir code. At a first iteration, this will be a direct translation of the [erlings](https://github.com/lambdaclass/erlings) to elixir, for the ones that don't want to/con't have time to learn erlang before elixir. Eventually, the order and topics might change to accomodate to a particular book or tutorial.

## Readings

- [Learn you some Erlang for great good!](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/). A great book on erlang, elixir's predecessor, running on the same virtual machine (the BEAM). It's also fully available online.
- [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition). A great book on elixir.
- Elixir [official tutorials](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.16/introduction.html).

Read our [guidelines](https://github.com/lambdaclass/guidelines).
